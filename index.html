                        <h3>Karenosaurus Rex</h3>
                        <p>Karenosaurus Rex is a mighty yet slightly dramatic dinosaur, forever ready to voice her dissatisfaction. 
                            With her tiny arms and an oversized sense of entitlement, she’s always on the lookout for an issue to escalate.</p>

                        <h3>The Witness</h3>
                        <p>The Witness was a dinosaur who met his end when the meteor fell, blissfully unaware of 
                            the chaos coming his way. Modern dinosaurs often argue he was the lucky one—never having to 
                            deal with the stress of mortgages, taxes, or customer service calls. He went out in one dramatic 
                            moment, free from the grind of modern life, leaving others to wonder if it was better to face extinction 
                            than to endure endless paperwork and bills.</p>

                        <h3>Adminosaurus</h3>
                        <p>The Adminosaurus is a creature built for efficiency, but forever trapped in the grind of office 
                            life. With its relentless drive to organize, file, and manage, this dinosaur is always a step 
                            away from a meltdown. Whether it’s chasing down missing documents, answering an endless stream of 
                            emails, or navigating the maze of office protocols, Adminosaurus is constantly on the move, determined 
                            to keep things running smoothly.</p>
